# mini
small projects or codes
these programs serve no major purpose other than them being fun to work with, and that they helped me learn python. 

double_pendulum.py
this was my first attempt to implement a mathematical model into a program. double pendulum is a chaotic system where 
the state of the system never repeats itself under normal circumstances. learning outcomes were understanding of 
python animation, and utility libraries such as numpy and scipy.

breakout.py
this is a very basic implementation of the popular arcade game "Breakout". i wanted to learn how to interact with an 
animation in python, and came to a conclusion that a game will be the best way to go about it. the learning outcome 
was a basic understanding of pygame.

schrodinger.py
this program is aimed towards generating approximate time dependent solution to a 1-D schrodinger wave equation. the 
program, for the most part, was inspired by the algorithm designed by Jake Vanderplas (http://jakevdp.github.com). 
learning outcomes were implementation of advanced mathematical functions like the Fourier transform using scipy's 
fftpack package.
